title: Research Software & Prototypes
---

Tools and prototypes developed within the research projects and PhD theses under my supervision:
- COBPAM - the algorithm we proposed for discovering behavioral patterns is available as
a plugin (BehavioralPatternMining package) in the Prom framework
(https://promtools.org) (software that integrates research contributions in the field of
process mining). It also integrates contextual analysis of patterns and their visualization.
- PPM-OC (Object centric predictive process monitoring) is software that enables
predictive monitoring of process execution based on its execution history. We use an
LSTM-type deep learning architecture that we adapt and extend to take into account the
presence and intersection of multiple objects. Link: https://github.com/wissamgherissi/
PPM-OC
- A framework for predictive monitoring (PPM) that allows the integration of different
predictive models and graph embeddings. Link: https://github.com/wissam-gherissi
- EmailMining: a prototype that uses machine learning to i) extract activities from emails
and ii) build business process instances, which group together these activities involved in
achieving a common goal. The approach is applied to an open data corpus. Link:\
