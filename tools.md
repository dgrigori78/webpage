\
Tools and prototypes developed within the research projects and PhD theses under my supervision:\
- COBPAM - the algorithm we proposed for discovering behavioral patterns is available as\
a plugin (BehavioralPatternMining package) in the Prom framework\
(https://promtools.org) (software that integrates research contributions in the field of\
process mining). It also integrates contextual analysis of patterns and their visualization.\
- PPM-OC (Object centric predictive process monitoring) is software that enables\
predictive monitoring of process execution based on its execution history. We use an\
LSTM-type deep learning architecture that we adapt and extend to take into account the\
presence and intersection of multiple objects. Link: https://github.com/wissamgherissi/\
PPM-OC\
- A framework for predictive monitoring (PPM) that allows the integration of different\
predictive models and graph embeddings. Link: https://github.com/wissam-gherissi\
- EmailMining: a prototype that uses machine learning to i) extract activities from emails\
and ii) build business process instances, which group together these activities involved in\
achieving a common goal. The approach is applied to an open data corpus. Link:\
